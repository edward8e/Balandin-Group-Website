                <p>NiO is a promising material for spintronic devices, where signals are transmitted not by electrical currents but rather by spin waves, consisting of propagating disturbances in the ordering of magnetic materials, in a domino-like fashion. The interdisciplinary team of researchers, led by Alexander Balandin, distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering, used ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy to investigate how spin ordering affects the energies of phonons in these materials. Phonons are quanta of vibrations of ions, which constitute the crystal lattice of materials. Phonons can interact with electrons and their spins, leading to energy dissipation. Practical applications of spintronic devices in information processing require accurate knowledge of the strength of the electron spin interaction with phonons. <a class="news-button" href="https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/50918" target="_blank"><strong>Read More...</strong></a>

                <p>Dr. Alexander A. Balandin, Distinguished Professor and University of California Presidential Chair Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering received two new grants in the nanotechnology field. The one-year $150 K proof-of-concept project funded by the Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) is entitled “Phonon Engineered Materials for Fine-Tuning the Career Recombination.” This project deals with an application of the nanoscale phonon engineering concept, pioneered by Professor Balandin, to the development of the next generation of devices that enable advanced electro-optic detection, sensing and imaging. The main idea of the approach is tuning the acoustic phonon energy dispersion in nanostructured materials for achieving optimum electron – phonon scattering rates, and corresponding improvement in the device performance. Phonons are the quanta of the crystal lattice vibrations that scatter electrons and conduct heat in semiconductors. The second, three-year $264 K project, funded by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), is entitled “Fabrication and Testing of Quasi-1D van der Waals Metal Interconnects”. The goal of this project is development of novel interconnects providing an ultimate atomic thickness limit of the cross-section. The technology will utilize quasi-one-dimensional (1D) van der Waals metals, which can be grown into individual single crystalline atomic threads with extraordinary current-carrying capability. Professor Balandin’s research group has already demonstrated the first quasi-1D crystalline nanowires with the current-densities exceeding copper by more than an order-of-magnitude. Professor Balandin will collaborate with Professor Ludwig Bartels, Department of Chemistry on implementation of this project. <a class="news-button" href="http://balandingroup.ucr.edu/highlights.html" target="_blank"><strong>Read More...</strong></a>

The symposium featured talks of the participating PIs and a poster session with the graduate student presentations. The symposium was attended by the SHINES Scientific Advisory Committee members from industry and government laboratories.  The Spins and Heat in Nanoscale Electronic Systems (SHINES) is an Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC) funded in 2014 with $12 million grant from the US Department of Energy. The SHINES Center aims to develop a fundamental understanding of electron spin and heat transport as well as the interplay between them in nanoscale electronic materials and devices. 
Fariborz Kargar, ECE PhD candidate in the Balandin Group, won one of the SHINES Best Poster awards for his research presentation on Brillouin – Mandelstam spectroscopy of acoustic phonons in semiconductor nanostructures.  The SHINES Center consists of 14 PIs from 7 institutions – UC Riverside, UCLA, UC Irvine, Johns Hopkins University, Colorado State University, Arizona State University, and University of Texas at Austin – plus two UCR PIs with seed projects. Prof. Jing Shi, Department of Physics and Astronomy, serves as the Center Director while Prof. Alexander Balandin, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, serves as an Associate Director.

                <p>Graphene has emerged as one of the most promising two-dimensional materials but the future of electronics may include two other nanomaterials, according to a new study in ECE Professor Balandin and ECE Professor Lake Groups at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of California – Riverside. In recent research published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, the researchers described the integration of three very different two-dimensional (2D) materials to yield a simple, compact, and fast voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) device. A VCO is an electronic oscillator whose oscillation frequency is controlled by a voltage input. Titled “An Integrated Tantalum Sulfide—Boron Nitride—Graphene Oscillator: A Charge-Density-Wave Device Operating at Room Temperature,” the paper describes the development of the first useful device that exploits the potential of charge-density waves to modulate an electrical current through a 2D material. The new technology could become an ultralow power alternative to conventional silicon-based devices, which are used in thousands of applications from computers to clocks to radios. The thin, flexible nature of the device would make it ideal for use in wearable technologies. The first author of the paper Dr. Guanxiong Liu – Postdoctoral Researcher in the Balandin Group – fabricated the devices and conducted their testing.  Bishwajit Debnath – PhD student in the Lake Group – performed modeling and simulation of the device operation. The research involved cooperation with Professor Tina Salguero from the University of Georgia who provided high-quality crystalline material for device fabrication. </p>

The Newsletter of the DOE Office of Science described recent results obtained by Balandin Group showing the acoustic phonon confinement effects in nanoporous arrays. Phonons are quanta of vibrations of solid materials. Understanding the changes in the acoustic phonon spectrum induced by spatial confinement is important for fine-tuning of the heat propagation in nanometer scale structures and electronic devices. Investigation of the acoustic phonons was made possible by developing the Brillouin-Mandelstam spectroscopy tool at the POEM Center.  Fariborz Kargar – Research Assistant and PhD Candidate in Balandin group – was the first author of the paper published in the Applied Physics Letters. The research work was conducted in the framework of the Spins and Heat in Nanoscale Electronic Systems (SHINES) Center – DOE funded Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) at UC Riverside. <a class="news-button" href="http://www.ece.ucr.edu/news-events/article.php?EID=321&Article=Balandin-Group-Research-Highlighted-by-the-US-Department-of-Energy" target="_blank"><strong>Read More...</strong></a></p>

                <p>It was recently announced by the American Institute of Physics (AIP) that the paper co-authored by MSE graduate student Rameez Samnakay and ECE graduate student Chenglong Jiang is the most assessed paper in the Applied Physical Letters journal in 2015. The paper entitled “Selective chemical vapor sensing with few-layer MoS2 thin-film transistors: Comparison with graphene devices” was published in January 2015. Rameez and Chenglon – the first authors of the paper – are PhD candidates in Professor Balandin’s Nano-Device Laboratory (NDL) and Phonon Optimized Engineered Materials (POEM) Center. According to the AIP press-release the paper from Balandin group came on top of the list of 25 papers that were the most-accessed articles from Applied Physics Letters published from January to March 2015. The paper that attracted the most interest deals with nano-fabrication of transistors with two-dimensional materials and testing their gas and chemical vapor sensing capabilities. Applied Physics Letters is the premier journal in the field of applied physics and engineering. <a class="news-button" href="http://www.ece.ucr.edu/news-events/article.php?EID=254&Article=Balandin-Group-Paper-is-the-Most-Accessed-in-Applied-Physics-Letters-" target="_blank"><strong>Read More...</strong></a></p>
